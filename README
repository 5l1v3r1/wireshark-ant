All of it is work in progress...

libant uses 2 threads: reader() and writer() to transfer data between
queues that are written and read by the application.

TODO

Add a mainloop and call back mechanism
Add burst transfers
lots more...

CHECKOUT:

WIRESHARK plugin:

The wireshark plugin is used to decode USB ANT traffic
which either uses a native program in linux, or an
ANT program within a vm such as in vmware. This program
could be a windows program. When the ANT program is
running (natively or within a VM), wireshark -ki usbmon3 -R ant
would decode all ANT traffic on that bus.
lsusb will show which bus the ANT (dynastream) stick is attached to.

To get wireshark working in linux, check out the latest
wireshark svn sources:

svn co http://anonsvn.wireshark.org/wireshark/trunk/ wireshark

checkout the latest sources from my nant repository. Edit the
iant script with the location of the pristine source directory
for wireshark and where you want the build copy to go.
./iant
that will copy the files into the plugins directory and build
it. You'll probably have to delete the original wireshark
binary and plugins in order not to interfere with them.

After that is done, you just need to cd to the plugins/ant
directory and do a make install whenever you edit the
dissector.
